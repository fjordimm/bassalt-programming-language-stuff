/*

An immutable type is defined as one of the following:
	A primitive
	A non-mutable mold
	A const class
	A tuple where every member is marked 'const', and therefore of an immutable type

Immutable type variables can have the 'const' modifier.
Non-immutable type variables can have the 'fixed' modifier.
