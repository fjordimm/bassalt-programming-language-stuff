Possible Solutions:
 - reference counted pointer (actually nvm this is what shared pointer does)
 - shared pointer and weak pointer (as in C++)
 - tombstones (https://oberoidearsh.medium.com/dangling-pointers-tombstones-and-lock-and-keys-f6bd0791810f)
 - locks and keys (https://oberoidearsh.medium.com/dangling-pointers-tombstones-and-lock-and-keys-f6bd0791810f)
 - locks and keys but there is one owner pointer who doesn't need to do key comparison every access, and also secondary pointers only need to do key comparison at the start of each scope
